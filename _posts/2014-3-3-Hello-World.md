title: Do We Need Teachers Anymore?
---


Recently I overheard a conversation about teachers referring pupils to Youtube for learning. The conclusion was that probably internet would replace teachers in the near future. This got me thinking.

The obvious question was whether the pupils be able to find what they were looking for without teachers' guidance. Do I need to tell you the answer? Chomsky in an interview commented that most of what search engines spit out for a search was just garbage. In the case of teenagers, guidance would be vital to pick up the relevant links. Spotting relevance however, does not necessarily warrant quality in the virtual world where accountability is a rare virtue to be found.

Having followed so many massive open online courses and sometimes supplementing them with online videos and readings for better understanding it was not hard to realise that they were not all equal. Although I do believe that there are many apt people who could pitch a topic as good as a teacher, I do not believe in general terms that a qualified teacher could be replaced by them. Even in the case of qualified good teachers taking the stage on online platforms the rapport that is built up between pupils and teachers over a sustained period of time will be missing. In other words learning and teaching are not solitory acts. They are socially situated.

There is an interesting argument by philosopher Searle known as Chinese room argument. Imagine a person sitting in a room given a Chinese text and very detailed instructions to match the words in the text with some other symbols and giving the results out. The instructions are so detailed that in fact she is translating Chinese into English without knowing a word of both languages. Could we conclude then the person understands Chinese and English? This is to challenge the view that there is no difference between artificial intelligence and minds. Searle concludes that minds are not machines translating some text according to some syntatic rules. I am suggesting that in the absence of required social context, learning online would not probably be very far removed from a person in the Chinese room.
